            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in machine learning, 
                allowing multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. 
                This paper explores its applications in cybersecurity, focusing on architectures, 
                attack resilience, and optimization strategies.

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                With the growth of cyber threats, the need for privacy-preserving and collaborative 
                security mechanisms has intensified. FL provides a framework to train robust 
                intrusion detection models while ensuring sensitive organizational data remains 
                local.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Federated Learning Architectures in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>
                Different FL architectures such as cross-device and cross-silo models have 
                been applied to distributed network security. These approaches enable collaborative 
                defense mechanisms across organizations.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Attacks and Defenses in FL</h2>
            <p>
                FL introduces new vulnerabilities, including model poisoning and inference attacks. 
                Defensive measures such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, and anomaly 
                detection are critical to safeguard the system.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Optimization and Personalization</h2>
            <p>
                Personalized FL strategies ensure that models adapt to heterogeneous data 
                distributions. Techniques like clustered FL and transfer learning improve 
                applicability in real-world cybersecurity.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                FL holds significant promise for advancing cybersecurity by enabling secure 
                collaboration. Future research should explore hybrid approaches combining 
                blockchain, edge computing, and federated reinforcement learning.

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            While converting this paper into HTML, I used semantic tags to preserve structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code> for the title and author details.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to wrap both the paper and addendum.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code> for major divisions (Abstract, Introduction, etc.).</li>
            <li><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for section headings for clear hierarchy.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> for references to maintain list format.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> with JavaScript for last modified date as required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My choices were guided by readability, semantic correctness, and future CSS styling 
            flexibility.

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
        <p>
            I chose a clean, modern sans-serif font (Roboto) for readability and professionalism. 
            Headings use larger sizes and bold weight to clearly separate sections. 
            The body text is 16px for comfortable reading.  
            The color palette uses a light background (#f9f9f9) with dark text (#222) for contrast, 
            and accent colors (navy blue for headers, teal for links) to guide attention.  
            I added generous margins and padding around sections and between paragraphs to reduce visual clutter 
            and improve flow.  
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
        <p>
            In Lab 2, I originally considered using an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for the essay title 
            because it looked visually better, but I corrected it to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> 
            since it is the highest-level heading. All visual adjustments are now handled in CSS, 
            not by misusing HTML tags.

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: 
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
